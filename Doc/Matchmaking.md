# Match Making API and Client side


## ``api/v1/config/MATCH_MAKING_REGIONS/raw``

This is called when you open the Matchmaking Menu. It returns a ARRAY of Strings.

If you have 1 string the "select region" button will be hidden.

EXAMPLE:

```json
[
  "EU",
  "NA",
  "ASIA"
]
```

## ``api/v1/queue``

This is called when you press the "SEARCH FOR MATCH" button in the Matchmaking Menu.

The client has a first and LOOP request.

The first request is to JOIN the queue.

EXAMPLE:
    
```json
{
    "category": "Steam-te-18f25613-36778-ue4-374f864b",
    "rank": 1,
    "side": "A",
    "latencies": [],
    "additionalUserIds": [],
    "checkOnly": false,
    "gameMode": "Default",
    "region": "EU",
    "countA": 1,
    "countB": 5
}
```

Explanation:

- ``category``: The game version.
- ``rank``: The rank of the player. (Never changes)
- ``side``: If you are a HUNTER or RUNNER
- ``latencies``: The latencies to the Servers. Sadly doesn't work and I think never worked?
- ``additionalUserIds``: The additional Users in your lobby. Run with friends.
- ``checkOnly``: If the player is only checking. The first request is ALLWAYS False so the API knows you want to join the queue.
- ``gameMode``: The game mode you want to play.
- ``region``: The region of the player. See ``api/v1/config/MATCH_MAKING_REGIONS/raw`` for the regions.
- ``countA``: How many players should be in team A. (HUNTERS) This is set in the GameMode.
- ``countB``: How many players should be in team B. (RUNNERS) This is set in the GameMode.

RESPONSE:

```json
{
    "queueData": {
        "ETA": -10000,
        "position": 0,
        "sizeA": 1,
        "sizeB": 0,
        "stable": false
    },
    "status": "QUEUED"
}
```

Explanation:

- ``ETA``: The estimated time to find a match. This is a leftover from OG Deathgarden. Now it is allways -10000.
- ``position``: Your position in the queue. This is a leftover from OG Deathgarden. Now it is allways 0.
- ``sizeA``: How many Hunters are queued.
- ``sizeB``: How many Runners are queued.
- ``stable``: I don't even know what this is...
- ``status``: The status of the queue. QUEUED means you are in the queue.

The LOOP request is to check if you found a match.

The REQUEST is the same but with ``checkOnly`` set to ``true``.

If you found a match the RESPONSE will be the Match response.

EXAMPLE:

```json
{
    "matchData": {
        "Players": [
            "52fbb7b6-j233-4by6-b462-0k473ceb730c"

- ``api/v1/match/{matchId}/register``

This is called when you HOST a match and have loaded the arena.

The HOST sends the SessionSettings to the API which in the future will be send to the players when they queue to this match see: ``api/v1/queue``

EXAMPLE:

```json
{
    "customData": {
        "SessionSettings": "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"
    }
}
```

The API then response the MatchData. See ``api/v1/{matchId}`` for the response.

## GET ``api/v1/match/{matchId}``

This is called when:
1. You join a Match
2. Every 5 seconds to check if the match is still alive.

The REQUEST is empty.

}
```

Explanation:

See ``api/v1/queue`` for the explanation.

## DELETE ``api/v1/match/{matchId}/user/{userId}``

This is called when UserID leaves the match.

## PUT ``api/v1/match/{matchId}/Kill``

This is called when the match is over and the HOST leaves the match.

The response is the same as before but with the status is ``KILLED`` now.

## PUT ``api/v1/match/{matchId}/Quit``

This is called when a player leaves the match.

## PUT ``api/v1/match/{matchId}/Close``

This is called when the HOST closes the match.

This means all runner and Hunters have joined. This is called when the COUNT DOWN starts.

## PUT ``api/v1/match/create``

This is called when you want to create a private match.

This SHOULD start a dedicated Server with the data sent in the REQUEST and after that the user join the queue WITHOUT the checkOnly set to true.

Request:

```json
{
   "category":"Steam-te-18f25613-36778-ue4-374f864b",
   "region":"US",
   "playersA":[
      "032uzd11-a346-yx35-sd4-2462e8d456aa4"
   ],
   "playersB":[
      "01658d11-2dfd-41e8-b6d2-2462e8d3aa47",
      "92041085-e7e4-4759-be3d-e72c69g67578",
      "0585496c-f0ae-44d3-a777-260927s0f39c"
   ],
   "props":{
      "MatchConfiguration":"/Game/Configuration/MatchConfig/MatchConfig_Demo.MatchConfig_Demo"
   },
   "latencies":[]
}
```

## GET, PUT ``api/v1/file/{game_version}/{seed}/{map_name}``

When the Hunter opens the arena it generates a Seed and map layout.

This file is then encrypted with the EncryptionKey and send to the API on this endpoint.

When the runners JOIN the match they will then download this file.

The REQUEST is a octet-stream.

The RESPONSE is the same as the REQUEST.
